  Hello,
  
  I whipped up a very basic subversion integration script so that it uses
  xxdiff when I do something like
  
  $ svn diff
  
  ok, here Is how I did it...
  
  I modified the svn diff-cmd in ~/.subversion/config
  
  To point to a script called xxdiff-sub which lives somewhere where the
  PATH can pick it up.
  
  What the xxdiff-sub does:
  
  1. checkouts out the files which have been changed into a temp directory
  (using svn cat)
  2. uses xxdiff to diff this file with what I got in my current dir
  
  xxdiff-sub is attached. The file is _VERY_ simple, and only tested for
  the svn diff [filenames] syntax
  
  I am no subversion and/or xxdiff expert, so I would like to contribute
  it to the community and get the experts to review/comment on it.
  Hopefully it's a step in the right direction to get subversion
  integration.
  
  Hope it helps someome!
  
  Regards,
  
  Saqib
