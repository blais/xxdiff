# This file contains a wishlist, todo list, a list of tasks and a general
# grubzone where the author feels free to plop in any worthy ideas and
# non-worthy ideas that come around.
#

Goals for 3.0 stable release:
------------------------------

   * Multiple horizontal diffs support (***DONE in 2.1).
   * CVS unmerge conflicts feature.
   * Save merged results feature (***DONE in 2.3).
   * Display-ignore related features (e.g. per-hunk ws ignore).
   * Support ignore-blank-lines (will use internal display-ignore feature)
   * Merged view pane display (***DONE in 2.2).
   * Some dirdiff improvements (exclude).
   * Qt-3.0 port.
   * Windows port using Qt-3.0 non-commercial license.
   * Make error recovery work better in rcfile parsing.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks: current tasks

   * Figure out how to produce the documentation from rpm file

   * When the selections change the merged view horizontal scrollbars should be
     adjusted.

   * Resizing line numbers label leaves white border c**d behind, perhaps it
     should clear the background before drawing.

   * xxdiff still has problems displaying accented chars.

   * Bug: not all control paths in the text rendering engine are setting
     skip. The merged lines counting routine either.

   * Bug in next difference:  use "mine older", then n many times.
     At some point the n command does not bring you to the beginning of a new region.

   * Merged length in lines is incorrectly calculated.

   * The line number labels are not initialized properly on startup.

   * Add cmdline option to show pane-merged view upon startup.

   * Consider using the SUP colors for the empty lines.

   * Scrollbar would be better if it always would be able to show at least a one
     pixel row at the very bottom.

   * Color documentation, shadowed might be "highlighted"... fix it.

   * You need to figure some decent scrolling heuristic for the merged view to
     follow the text views, especially when they are radically different sizes.
     Right now it just follows the cursor.

   * Post-central testing:  test setting tab width, see if horizontal scrollbars
     adjust automatically.

   * Make rpm spec generate documentation automatically.

   * Remove uint, put standard "unsigned int" instead.

   * In merged view, the stippled pattern doesn't scroll horizontally.



(Multiple Horizontal Diffs)

   * Can we actually do something about 3-way horizontal diffs?
     Compute the 2-way and then merge results?

   * We could remove empty horizontal regions from horizontal diffs?  They don't
     hurt but we could draw more efficiently without them if we don't use them.

   * Perhaps draw a little dent on the side where an insertion/deletion occured.
     With an option.

   * Perhaps group all the horizontal diffs display options together.

(IgnoreBlankLines)

   * IgnoreBlankLines is a fundamental misfeature with xxdiff... how to deal
     with it?  figure it out later.
      * Check '-B' option in cmdline.cpp

      * The problem is that the SAME regions might not have the same length...
        how do we do this?  perhaps mark those regions as "display-ignore" when
	that is implemented.


(Bugs)

   * In resources::setQuality... setOneOfInCommand, does it remove the options
     that are present if the one to set is empty?

   * Once xxdiff is up, if you change the options for the diff command and give
     it options that make it fail, no error message is printed, no dialog,
     nothing, it just goes empty.

   * Figure out why when a char isn't read by lex/yacc it is printed on stdout,
     and fix that, it's annoying and stupid

   * Redo diff clears selections!  can we do something about it?


(CVS unmerge conflicts)

   FIXME continue implementing --conflict in app::processfilenames()

   * diff3 and cvs markers seem to be different, perhaps implement parser for
     both.

   * Implement remerge option!  for files with CVS conflicts!

     Build the two diffs using a single file, and a single file storage, to save
     memory (and avoid having to build two files), also be able to do it with
     ifdefs.

   * Check for precise syntax of CVS conflict markers

      * How is it different with 3 files? does this make any sense? diff3 -m?

      * What happens when a conflict text contains conflict markers?

      * Compare our current output tags, are they ok?

      * Added resources for input tags for parser.


(Improve Directory Diffs)

> *  Improve the comparison options for directories. Files and Dirs
>    should be selectively comparable for time, mode, owner,group,
>    and raw and filterd data.
>    I could write the backend of this part, if you like to include
>    this ability, but I can't write the front end (gui) part.


(Misc)

   * Try compiling with g++3.

   * Change file builders to use QCString internally.

   * Optimize parsing the diff outputs, this big series of if-else is
     inefficient, diff2 and diff3 both for files

   * Check out if we can make use of the QApplication useGUI parameter instead
     of not creating the QApplication at all... does it try to open the display
     when set to false?

   * Put all the resources text as what's this in the options dialog

   * Bug: for certain fonts, the text is not drawn completely without the
     fillrect... a line shows up under the text... fix this.
     (In the worst case, detect and fill by hand.)

   * bug: ^L's do not get rendered correctly?...

   * --titlein does not fail when no file is given in stdin.
     This is harmless but perhaps it would be nice to check and warn that this
     does not make sense to specify.


(New display-ignore line type)

   * Add colors and line type for display-ignored type, defaults should be close
     to SAME color

   * Ignore horizontal whitespace option should make simple SAME lines almost
     'SAME' color.  (i.e. if there are only whitespace differences, almost
     ignore it!)

   * Implement "per-line display-ignore whitespace" (easy, check bounds of
     result from horizontal diffs)

   * "Per-hunk ignore whitespace" (ignores whitespace if a hunk's non-whitespace
     chars are all the same... this should allow filtering out most code
     re-indentation and such).  Newlines have to match (but you can skip some).


(Token horizontal diffs)

   * Token horizontal diffs computation option (idea from idanan)

   * Case-sensitive Horizontal diffs?



(Web site)

   * Add emacs trick to start xxdiff automatically on previous file

   * Add to google direcotry!!!

   * Add directories
   * From freshmeat, "run query" link
   * Links from Perfore web site

   * Add link to apps.kde.com entry (which is pretty much up-to-date).


(Improve options dialog synchronization)

   * Sync options dialog

     * For options dialog, on synchronize() we should really only update the
       controls which haven't been changed.  how do we do that?  perhaps have it
       work on a different resources object?

     * Apply display box resets horizontal diffs...
       Options dialog has to update on resources changes...
       ... figure out something with a second copy of the resources object.


(Try using Mightnight Commander backend)

> *  If xxdiff calls the vfs layer of midnight commander instead of
>    unix filesystem functions directly, it could enter and compare
>    even archive contents and ftp servers.
>    The libfs-mc.so is a sub project within mc and independent
>    of mc.
>
>    The required changes to the existing xxdiff code are an
>    exchange  of the unix calls with their vsf counter parts and
>    one initialization/shutdown call at start and program end.
>
>    eg:   open(..) becomes  mc_open(..),


(Internal diffs)

   * Enable internal GNU diff as a runtime option

   * Implement the 3-way and dir. version of this (not done yet)

   * Internal diff: must set status with correct values as external diff
     this currently does not work with files being the same


(Port to Qt-3.0)

   * Implement reading process output with QProcess

   * Port to Windows using the Qt Non-commercial license 3.0, or mingw32


(Misc GUI stuff)

   * Add an option to draw a pattern within empty lines, to make them stand out
     more (not just a color).

   * While selecting the colors, implement a color picker so you could select a
     color in the text view

   * Add support for wheel events, even in overview area.

   * Add an easter egg, pretty much noone ever looks at the source code.

   * Allow selection of text, as in an editor, just for cut-n-paste purpose
     (line based only though).

   * Selecting many lines in a big hunk one-by-one is lame.
     Do something at the same time that you implement region selection.
     Extended selection (on mouse release normal click except when straddling 
     lines) allow larger selection (smarter key down/up processing).
     Region Selection for the purpose of cut-n-paste.

   * Add invert selection functionality

   * "What's this?" on a file widget should babble about the specific region
     which was clicked on.

   * It would be nice to be able to select both sides of a hunk for making 
     merge comments... but thru which UI do we do this?

   * Popup menu should implement selection instead of motion commands, maybe 
     depending on if clicked on an IGNORE region or not;

   * Add more/less contrast buttons for easy changing all colors simulatneously
     for horizontal diffs.


(Search results)

   * Make each line able to contain multiple search results instances (a list).

   * Draw brackets around search results, over text area, highlighting search
     results.

   * Add case sensitivity to search feature.

   * Search using regexp.

   * Add a status bar -like widgets line at the bottom, with exclude lineedits
     and search widgets, and make it work a la emacs.


(Ignore regexp/pattern)

   * Use display-ignore feature to ignore certain regexp

   * Use display-ignore feature to ignore change from regexp A to regexp B
     (gijsbert)

   * Add a line at the bottom for interactive search widget and ignore pattern
     widgets (line edits)


(Temporary files)

   * Does xxdiff try to cleanup tmp file on startup? if so that is a bug, 
     because one can run multiple xxdiff's on the host.

   * Unlink the temporary files right away, the problem is that we need the temp
     file around for "redo diff", investigate using mknod() instead just during
     the time we redo the diff, so that we really insure we don't leave some old
     temporary files lying around when the user interrupts xxdiff (or when we
     crash ;-)).

   * Perhaps implement using a catched signal to delete tmp files?

   * Can I use a named pipe instead?  would that be better?
     does it just delete itself once it's done?



(Documentation)

   * Rename "regions" to "hunks" and use GNU diff terminology from texinfo





   * Open left/right on an empty xxdiff should allow to open! 
     Supporting one file only.  (on startup AND on an open diff) this can be
     done easily by specifying the "other" file as an empty file and running
     the current diff parser.

   * Add an option for splitting all CHANGE regions automatically (buh?)

   * Add an option to display context format diffs into its own widget, like 
     for the line numbers.

   * allow insertion of marker lines

   * Add save options for save selected only file dialog;

   * Keep the cursor line in region after swap->merge transition;

   * feature: show only hunks, collapse ignore regions...

   * feature: ignore diffs from "this" to "that" (-I option) should we have a
     different color for ignored diffs?  say e.g. case insensitivity done at the
     xxdiff level (for that the ``ignore'' algorithm must be done by xxdiff 
     itself)


(More checks and verification)

   * Check if can parse context, ed, normal, or unified diffs output, the user
     might specify such an erroneous command;


(Force merged file production)

   * Finish implementing feature to force the user to produce a merged file.

   * File dialog must have its selection disabled... we want only the conflicts
     section to show up in the worst case.

(Misc)
   
   * Rewrite rendering engine for merged view like the text one!  can we share
     the code?


   * Merged view option to draw all hunk texts instead of men-at-work pattern

   * Fix all issues raised in merged.cpp FIXME comments.

   * Merged view: the motion commands should work from the merged view.

   * Selection commands should work too

   * Scrolling the merged view should scroll the other view as well.

   * Merged view cannot mouse-drag properly.  Implement a more viable solution
     that will allow to to the inverse drag as well, perhaps setting up a
     publicly-available indirection table in the XxDiffs object.

   * Merged view: add different colors for different selected sides

   * Merged view: display both regions in merged view when unselected 
     (as an option)

   * Add "show merged view on startup" resource.

   * Merged view: should have the option of seeing both files' hunks instead of
     "work" lines.


(One-Pane View)

   * Support one-pane view, where both selections are shown together in one text
     view.  Do this for merged view only.  Perhaps allow selection there.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks: Editing

   * Implement some editing in the merged view!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks: Patch support.


(Patch input support)

   * Make it able to read in a patch and apply it, without the second file

   * Allow diff using a patch file, even containing a patch for many files
     (easy: you could let patch patch the file on stdout, grab the output and
     perform normal diff)


(Patch output support)

   * Make it able to output a patch


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks: Directory diffs improvements and bug fixing.

(Directory Diffs Misc)

   * Don't show vertical line on directory diffs!

   * In dirdiffs mode, cut-n-paste should just put the clicked filename (one
     side) in the clipboard, without the \n.

   * Launching xxdiff dirs with two same directories results in an empty buffer
     thingy, because diff itself just silently returns.

   * New functionality that spawns a bunch of diffs for all the changed files
     in a directory (dirdiffs only).
   
   * In dir diffs, remove toolbar buttons, selection menus, open file must be
     able to select a directory, etc. IOW finish checking that all that is left 
     works.

   * Add exclude option to diff options

   * Show symlinks, date and size of files in directory diffs

   * Add an icon somewhere to show if a directory diff or a simple file diff

   * Add a file viewer command for dirdiff to spawn on inserts and deletes in
     dirdiff mode!  That would be great!

Tasks: CM integration

(CVS revisions browsing)

   * Write independent app running in a different process to dnd CVS revisions

   * Make the text area a drop site for files, so files from the other guy or
     from some file manager could be dropped right into it and be diffed
     automatically.  This will require some non-trivial temporary file diddling.

(Xxscripts)

   * Implement xxcvs update.

   * CVS and Clearcase: write interface/protocol scripts

   * Mv xxct to xxcleartool and implement using distutils

   * Separate cvs stuff from xxcvs into cvslib, use distutils

(General CM support)

   * Some features:

     | When I mentioned "checkout" above, in cvs it's called "edit", so we're talking
     | about the same thing:

     | 
     | xxdiff already does that.  If you call it on two directories, you can select
     | files and use the popup menu to get an xxdiff of the specific files.
     | 
     | xxdiff also works recursively on directories.  It makes it really easy to
     | compare hierarchies this way (this is how I merge my configuration files, for
     | example).
     | 
     | However, you just gave me another idea: one may wish to compare tagged
     | versions, as a directory diff, e.g. compare hierarchy with 1.8 tag and 1.9
     | tag.  I'll look into how I could do this. This would be a cool feature.  Do
     | you get it?  for example, you could spawn a directory diff in your current
     | directory, asking xxdiff to compare with the latest tagged versions.



(Annotations)

   * Somehow support annotations within xxdiff, with input perhaps from some
     script, perhaps integrated from C++.

     | 
     | Surely it could be nice to be able to extract and display the log comments for
     | shown revisions, good idea! I'll add it in.



(Binary Diffs)

   * Idea (plante@iro): Pour faire des diffs de fichiers binaires...
     Sers-toi d'un programme qui fait des hexdumps (sur linux il y a xxd), et 
     fais le diff la-dessus. Ça marche bien.
